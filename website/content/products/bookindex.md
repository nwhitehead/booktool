## Overview

This product is a software application that uses artificial intelligence to help you
create a professional index for your book.

## How it works

You supply your book content in PDF format. The software extracts text from your
PDF and builds the index. The final index will be returned to you as additional
PDF pages. You'll also get other convenient formats that can be pasted into your
original book source (formatted text to paste into Microsoft Word, HTML,
Markdown).

The PDF book content you supply will be used for the page numbers and page
ranges in the index. This means the final index will depend on your text
content, input paper size, typefaces, margins, and other layout choices. If
anything changes in your input the index will need to be regenerated to update
page numbers.

To control index generation you can select many options. You can choose your
desired level of detail in the index, desired level of term redundancy, and
choose which indexing conventions to follow. You can provide a list of terms
that must appear in the index, and a list of terms you do not want to appear in
the index.

## Technology

Internally the software works by "reading" your content
